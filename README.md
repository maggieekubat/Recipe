# Recipe project

This is a recipe project that simplifies finding a recipe without having to scroll through lots of unnecessary information. Every user can access the already created recipes that are shown on the index (home) page. Only an admin can add, edit and delete recipes.

Please make sure to log out of admin mode before leaving the website
