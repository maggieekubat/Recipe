    recipe: title, link, ingredients, instructions


Recently I've been getting more into cooking which means me and my friends are often sending each other recipes. These are all in such different forms; some are a website other pictures from cookbooks and some videos.
I find it very annoying when I want to cook something and I have to watch through the whole video to find what steps have to be done with which ingredients.
I decided the Web Dev Basics class would be a good oppertunity to make something useful for me and my friends to use. One person can input the recipe once on the website and the rest of us can find them in an easy to read way, all in the same place.
